# cookbook
Simple application to store and fetch recipes

Incomplete, no longer in progress, currently not usable.

I've stopped working on this because I've discovered https://github.com/mrzapp/nextcloud-cookbook/ which does almost everything I wanted this app to do.

I might restart work on this if I find nextcloud-cookbook doesn't suit my needs.

Things nextcloud-cookbook does well that I haven't thought of:

* Re-uses existing schema.org schema for recipes. Saves from re-inventing the wheel and get more potential interoperability for free.

Things I would like to see in nextcloud-cookbook (will either fix in nextcloud-cookbook, give me a reason to continue working on my version, or I'll just get used to it):

* Search by ingredient
* Able to use without nextcloud
* Able to easily share (nextcloud makes it easy to share the .json file, but I would prefer if it could be shared in its human readable format)
